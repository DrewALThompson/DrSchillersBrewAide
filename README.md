# DrSchillersBrewAide

A very tongue in cheek MVP of a website. The basis being you can login, make a recipe and chat with your fellow brewers. This website is meant to show the framework of what will hopefully be a very useful forum posting website in the future. However, it was done in Sinatra and will not be progressed further until I get the chance to revamp it with Ruby on Rails.

## Installation

Fork or copy this to your own repository,, load it up, bundle install and then rackup or shotgun as you please.

## Usage

Follow the links on the website and interact with it however you wish! Look forward to the Rails version which will be packed with loads more functionality.
